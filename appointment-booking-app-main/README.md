# souvik-appointment-booking-app MERN stack
I made this appointment booking app using MERN (mongo/express/react/node) stack with jwt authentication for both user and admin accounts. I have implemented protected routes in this project which limits pages based on the person logging it (whether it is a auser or an admin). The users can make a booking and also delete it to make another booking. The admin can see the bookings of all the users.

# Check out the live app here:-

# Steps for User:-
1) make an account.
2) log in.
3) click on new booking link to go that page.
4) make a booking.
5) go to my bookings page and see your booking.
6) to make a new booking, delete the previous booking from my booking page and go back to new booking page to make a new booking.
7) you can logout by clicking on logout button

# Steps for admin:-
1) make an account.
2) log in.
3) click on all bookings link to go that page.
4) there you can see the bookings from all users.
5) you can delete any booking you want.
6) you can logout by clicking on logout button

# I might add more features in future.
